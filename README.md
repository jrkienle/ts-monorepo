# @jrkienle's TypeScript Monorepo

A monorepo for all of my TypeScript projects

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hey there! This repo is home to all of my currently in progress, public TypeScript projects. If
anything here gets big enough I might move it to its own repo/org, but I'm not counting on that.
Feel free to dig through anything in here, but please don't expect any official support as these
projects are mostly experiments that I do in my free time. With that in mind, enjoy!

## License

Everything in this repo is licensed under the MIT license. If you either don't know what that means
or really want to dig into the license for whatever reason, check out [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
