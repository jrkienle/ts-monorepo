# @jrkienle's TypeScript Monorepo

A monorepo for all of my TypeScript projects

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hey there! This repo is home to all of my currently in progress, public TypeScript projects. If
anything here gets big enough I might move it to its own repo/org, but I'm not counting on that.
Feel free to dig through anything in here, but please don't expect any official support as these
projects are mostly experiments that I do in my free time. With that in mind, enjoy!
